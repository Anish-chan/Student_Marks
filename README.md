Student Marks and Grades Summary
This project is a Python-based solution for calculating and summarizing student performance. It uses a Jupyter notebook to process student data, compute various metrics, and visualize the class's overall performance.

 Features
Student-wise Summary: Calculates the total marks, average score, and a final grade for each student.

Class Summary: Provides an overview of the entire class, including the overall class average and details of the class topper.

Data Visualization: Generates and saves a box plot to visualize the distribution of student average marks, clearly marking the class average and the topper.

 Repository Structure
The project has a straightforward structure:

code.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing the logic for data processing, calculations, and plotting.

cleaned_student_data.csv: A sample CSV file containing the raw student data used by the notebook.

README.md: This file, which provides an overview of the project.

boxplot_class_topper.png: The output image file generated by the notebook, showing the class performance distribution.

 Requirements
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed.

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

⚙️ Setup and Usage
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name

Install the requirements:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter notebook:
You can open and run the notebook using the Jupyter interface. If you don't have Jupyter, you can install it first:

pip install jupyter
jupyter notebook

This command will open a web-based interface in your browser. From there, you can navigate to code.ipynb and run all the cells.

 Output
Running the notebook will produce the following:

A printed summary in the notebook's output, detailing the performance of each student and the overall class.

A new image file named boxplot_class_topper.png will be saved in the project directory, containing the visualization of the class's performance.
